                <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is
                    to inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportmanship and
                    fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator,
                    administrator, referee whose behavior detracts from this
                    purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                    technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments, or
                    standing.</p>
